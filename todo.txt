CAR
==================================================================================================
- move all the functinos in ir_transiever.h to ir_transiever.c (be consistent)
-clean up ir code in main. It's horrendous and causes errors that take up time
	- is there a way to get rid of the RTOS? It's slow.
		-maybe the while loop in main should just be empty
	- order more of the correct resistor for the IR led
-I don't like that I'm setting a global variable to shoot the laser from the main loop.
	- can that be changed to be called when the packet is recieved?




SCORE_BOARD
==================================================================================================
- create website
